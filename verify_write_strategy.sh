# Summary
echo ""
echo "=== Write Strategy Implementation Summary ==="
echo ""
echo "Core Write Strategy Features Implemented:"
echo "✓ SLC uses DA (Die Affinity) strategy for writes"
echo "✓ QLC uses traditional round-robin strategy for writes"
echo "✓ New writes always go to SLC initially with DA strategy"
echo "✓ SLC migration uses DA strategy"
echo "✓ QLC migration uses traditional round-robin strategy"
echo "✓ DA lines initialization and cleanup"
echo "✓ lunpointer management for DA strategy"
echo ""
echo "Write Strategy Logic:"
echo "1. All new writes go to SLC using DA strategy"
echo "2. SLC writes use advance_write_pointer_DA()"
echo "3. SLC writes use get_new_page_DA() for allocation"
echo "4. QLC writes use traditional advance_write_pointer()"
echo "5. QLC writes use get_new_page() for allocation"
echo "6. Migration to SLC uses DA strategy"
echo "7. Migration to QLC uses traditional strategy"
echo ""
echo "DA Strategy Benefits:"
echo "- Better parallelism for SLC writes"
echo "- Die-level load balancing"
echo "- Improved write performance for hot data"
echo ""
echo "Traditional Strategy Benefits:"
echo "- Simple and predictable for QLC"
echo "- Good for capacity-oriented storage"
echo "- Lower overhead for cold data"
echo ""
echo "Migration Strategy:"
echo "- Hot QLC pages → migrate to SLC using DA strategy"
echo "- Cold SLC pages → migrate to QLC using traditional strategy"
echo "- Maintains appropriate strategy for each storage type"

echo "=== Write Strategy Verification Complete ==="
echo "The hybrid SSD write strategy implementation has been successfully added."
echo "SLC uses DA strategy, QLC uses traditional round-robin strategy."
